    details: `For this project, I worked with a blacksmith who needed a way to showcase his work online. I decided to use a headless content management system (CMS) to allow the blacksmith to easily upload photos of his creations himself.\n I first worked with the blacksmith to determine his needs and design preferences for the website. I then set up the CMS and configured it to allow for easy photo uploads. I also made sure that the website was mobile-responsive and had a clean, professional design that would showcase the blacksmith's work effectively.\n Overall, this was a rewarding project that allowed me to utilize my skills in web development and CMS management to help a small business owner showcase their talents online. The blacksmith was very happy with the final result and has received positive feedback from customers who have viewed the website.`,
